A controller inspired by the Frame1 and Smashbox controllers

## Case
### BOM
 - 36 M2 screws, countersunk head recommended
 - 18 M2 threaded spacers
 - 35 pieces of wire, stranded or solid core

### Build notes
***Due to height constraints, surface mounted LEDs can not be used along with low profile Choc switches in this iteration of the design***

The controller case is designed to be made out of cut sheets of material, such as laser cut wood/acrylic or metal.
I recommend a thickness of 3mm for the top plate for use with low profile Choc switches, and 6mm for use with regular MX switches to ensure keycaps protrude nicely without the sides of the switches being exposed.
The switch mounting plate needs to be 1.5mm thick to fit the Cherry MX/Kailh Choc design specs and ensure a good fit, thinner plates may cause poor mounting and thicker plates will interfere with Choc switch mounting.
